## Activity 3 - Fork and Clone

Each group member will take turns updating the repository

1. Choose a group member to go first
2. The first member should:
	1. In the web browser navigate to [this link](https://github.com/code-differently/my-first-git-project). Notice in the top left it displays 'code-differently/my-first-git-project'. This is a code differently repository.
	2. In the upper right corner you will find a button labeled 'fork', click it. This will now create a copy of this repository and put it into your account. Notice the top left corner of the page. Now it has your user name.
	3. Just below your user name and the name of the repository, you will find a horizontal list of links. Choose 'Settings'
	4. In the left side navigation you will find a button for 'Manage Access', click it
	5. Now on the right you see a section labeled 'Manage Acces', click the green 'Invite a collaborator'. This will allow you to git access to other developers to work on the repository with you.
	6. Add your team mates as collaborators. The will need to confirm using the email that is sent to them.
3. Each team member should:
	4. 	Navigate to this repository on github.com. 
	5. In the right of the page, they will find a green button labeled 'code', 
	6. select this and copy the address under 'HTTPS'.
	7. In Terminal, navigate to the folder that has all your projects and type `git clone <the-copied-address-from-github>'. This will clone the repository to the local machine
9. A second team member should:
	1. Open a code editor.
	2. Open the folder that was just created in their class projects folder.
	3. Open the index.html file.
	4. Create an `h1` tag and enter a team name for the group
	5. Use git to add and commit the changes
	6. Use `git push` to push the changes to the github repository
10. Each team member should:
	1. Verify that they are in the 'my-first-git-project` directory.
	2. Use `git pull` to pull down the changes made to the remote github repository. Do you see the changes?
11. Choose another team member to go next. This team member should:
	1. Add a <ul> tag to index.html with each team member as list items.
	2. With Git, add and commit the changes
	3. Push the changes to GitHub
12. Each team member should pull the changes from GitHub.
13. Continue this process of modifing the index.html file and pushing/pulling the changes to/from github until all members have done the exercise.
